  <h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>

  <p style = "font-size: 20px; color:black;">
    This is a living website of sorts where I will be documenting
    my journey in teaching myself to program. Click on the links above to
    see my progress!
  </p>

  <h1>About Me:</h1>

  <p style = "font-size: 20px; color:black; text-align: left">
    I am Eliezer Shahid, an Electrical Engineer who graduated from the
    University of Delaware in 2020. In school I specialized across a wide
    range of subjects from Renewable Energy, to Circuits, to Semiconductors,
    and Signal Processing. After graduation I accepted a full time Electrical
    Engineering position at Phase Sensitive Innovations Inc. (PSI). At PSI,
    I did a lot of work on Thin Film Lithium Niobate modulators. Specifically I
    helped with the design process for low-loss, index matching electrodes for
    use in the aforementioned modulators. Along with my duties, I had many
    opportunities in writing scripts in various programming languages. From my time
    at PSI, I wrote scripts in MATLAB, Python, and Ruby for various tasks and
    automation. In addition to coding at my job, I have taken time outside of work
    to learn and improve my programming through various projects (shown below) such as this
    website.
    For more information on my achievements and duties, please find
    a link to my resume below!

<h1>Random Pizza Generator Google Chrome Extension</h1>

<p style = "font-size: 20px; color:black;">
This project started out when a friend and I could not decide what sort of pizza
to order from Dominos. I joked that we should build a pizza randomizer that has
capability to order a random pizza automatically for you from dominos.com.
From there I decided to go ahead and start working on this project. Knowing that
it would be a web application, I decided to work on the randomizer script in JavaScript.
After the script had been tested and confirmed working I went ahead and worked on
designing an HTML page for the randomizer. Once that was completed, I went ahead and
started integrating it into a Google Chrome extension. All the project files can be
found on my GitHub account under the "randomPizzaGenerator" repository.

<h2>What I Learned From this Project</h2>
<p style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">
This project was a good jumping off point for learning about web development.
I learned how to use the React.Js framework, how to instantiate and test a
web extension in Google Chrome using JSON, and how to link different code files together;
something that I have always wondered and did not have much experience with from my time in
school. I got the opportunity to re-learn HTML and CSS, and also got the opportunity to
actually build something with JavaScript. This first project I believe is a good
exercise in learning and understanding what front end development looks like. I had a
lot of fun with this project and am looking forward to doing more things like this.
</p>

<h2>How to Make This Project Better</h2>
<p style = "font-size: 18px; color: black;">
As of right now, I am still working on having the extension communicate with dominos.com
to automatically place the order for you once approved. I would like to add a surprise function
which would place the order and not tell you what the pizza is until you receive the pizza.
