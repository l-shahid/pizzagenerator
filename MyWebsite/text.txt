I am Eliezer Shahid, an Electrical Engineer who graduated from the
University of Delaware in 2020. In school I specialized across a wide
range of subjects from Renewable Energy, to Circuits, to Semiconductors,
and Signal Processing. After graduation I accepted a full time Electrical
Engineering position at Phase Sensitive Innovations Inc. (PSI). At PSI,
I did a lot of work on Thin Film Lithium Niobate modulators. Specifically I
helped with the design process for low-loss, index matching electrodes for
use in the aforementioned modulators. Along with my duties, I had many
opportunities in writing scripts in various programming languages. From my time
at PSI, I wrote scripts in MATLAB, Python, and Ruby for various tasks and
automation. For more information on my achievements and duties, please find
a link to my resume below!

This is a living website of sorts where I will be documenting
my journey in teaching myself to program. Click on the following links to
